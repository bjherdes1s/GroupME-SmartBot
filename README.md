To be used in conjuction with Heroku and deployed with git Heroku tools. 
Without a hosting platform or port forwarding on your own home web server,
your capabilities will be minimal with a groupme bot. 

*Purposes of this project*

1. Read message in a groupme group with a bot made with GroupME REST API
2. If message equals a specific trigger, perform further function
3. The goal further function, in my case, is a POST request to turn on/off 
a TP-Link Smart Plug. 

For a full implementation of this project, GroupME API must be utilized as
well as the TP-Link web service API, specifically for the Kasa App-like POST
request.
